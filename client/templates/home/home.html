                                        <h3>Guidelines for creating content and concepts.</h3>
                                        <h5>To make the best out of our tools, think about what concepts your lesson relates to. Be as specific as possible, do not just pick "arithmetic" if your content only makes use of integer sums. Organize your content in units that teach or test something specific, don't break it in several parts that all teach the same. If a concept doesn't exist or isn't exactly what you need, create it, and later add it to your content.</h5>
                                        <h5>Be as picky as you need be with concepts. For example, if your content only describes what a bicycle is but teaches no practical techniques, pick (or create) a concept which is "descriptive knowledge of bicycles". You can later link that concept to more practical ones.</h5>

                                        <h3>Guidelines for linking concepts</h3>
                                        <h5>Sometimes it is enough to know two concepts to understand a third, without having to be taught. Consider verb conjugation, for instance: if you know "to make (verb)" and you know "present tense -s ending" then you know how to use the word "makes", and vice-versa. Which is why you can add the verb to make and the -s conjugation as subcomponents of "makes".</h5>
                                        <h5>This technique also works for grouping concepts together, such as sums, subtractions, multiplications and divisions under basic arithmetic. We can't stress this enough: you're entirely free to create as subtlely specific a concept as you like!</h5>
