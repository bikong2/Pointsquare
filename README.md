# Pointsquare #

Pointsquare is an open online platform being developed with the goal of connecting the webâ€™s content to create personalized adaptive learning paths. 

**[Demo Page](https://pointsquare.herokuapp.com/)**  
**[Presentation Page](http://pointsquare.org/)**  

The internet is a fertile ground for knowledge. Everyday independent creators post new content about virtually anything. Pointsquare is bringing structure to that content, so that every learner may have a course accurately tailored to their skill set and personal goals. This means that if a student fails a lesson, the next lesson will change based on this outcome. Or that you are never presented content which you already know "just because that is how the course was designed".


## How does it work? ##
### Types of content ###  
- **Units**   
any type of learning content - such as videos, exercises, markdown text
- **Concepts**  
the theoretical concepts discussed in each unit - such as *power notation* or *the square root of a number* 
- **Exams**  
bundles of exercises which you can try to solve. In case you fail any exercise we will find the shortest learning path for you to learn it and get ready for the exam

### Indexing content ###  
**Units** of content which already exist in other open platforms are added to Pointsquare by contributors. During this process the units are tagged for the **concepts** they require to know beforehand and the **concepts** they will teach the student. **concepts** are defined and created by the contributors.
